# Chord_embeddings_for_stylistic_analysis

Theory: Chord meaning is gained from contextual (and probabilistic) occurences—--that is, things that are likely to occur near one another are associated. <br> <br>

Project: Use word2vec to develop chord embeddings for different musical styles. The aim is that the chord embeddings should be different, reflecting nuances from their respective styles. These chord embeddings should be housed in vector spaces that emulate our intuition about the musical style, and we can also use the embeddings for analysis.
